          <p class="font-italic p-3">The music center has an area for children to come and paint as they like. I was do not like children at first, I thought they were so annoying until I have a chance to contact with them everyday. <br>
	 And my small corner became a place where everyone in center could come and tell me about their day. Parents confide in me about their child, then I gradually understand a moms heart, when her kid has mental problem so he is such a hothead and became taciturn but super annoying. <br>
	 If you know how to communicate with them, and they find can lean on you, children world is a cosy place to work with.</p>

            We attended contests about dancing, painting, all the times we got in the final round.<br>
                     It is not recorded, but in my school profile, all my homeroom teachers describe me as sociable, frequently participate in school activities. It helps me build my teamwork skill.</p>

          <p class="font-italic">My most rough experience in high school is our National high school exam, there was a mistake with my profile, I was a student in a social class from grade 11 and of course, I signed up for social faculty which is history, geography and civic education but only 2 days before the exam I knew that it all has been changed due to some computer error. It was changed to science faculty, as physics, biography and chemistry, which I spent no time to revise and practice. My school did contact to Department of Education and Training in Hanoi but it was not able to change because of the exam's security. So I have to study 3 subjects which I was really bad at in 2 days in order to get my high school diploma. All that year national exam's test-takers, I was the only one who responded to that error.<br>
          My result after that was not very bad to me. But all the blame and pressure got me grown up, I learned how to stay positive and cope with bad things.</p>

         <p class="w-50 font-italic">Back then I was good at Korean, which is my second foreign language in the school profile, then I found I really like Chinese, but English is still my priority. In high school I only studied in class, after graduation I learnt english myself without school, without tutors then I got IELTS 6.5 that not high but still make me happy, and day by day I'm still improving my english. <br>
          I can communicate chinese quite well in familiar situations, I studied in Chinese center for 6 months then continue to learn at home til now. <br>
          I have to say that the internet is the most wonderful thing for me in my study path.
