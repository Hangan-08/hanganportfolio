	<h3 class="name mx-auto">Hi, my name is &nbsp;  <span class="spc">Ngan</span></h3>
	<p>And Noisy corner is my little assignment at school.
		<br><br>
		I was born in HCM city and have living there for 20 years with my parents and brother. Like many people, i'm an ordinary person, i eat and go to school. Teacher said that i could use placeholder text but then he changed his mind so that's why i'm writting this.</p>
	<h3>By the way, I'm really into pet</h3>
	<a class="puppy"><img src="pic/shiba.jpg" width="30%"></a>
	There is evidence that interacting with pets does reduce peopleâ€™s stress, provided the pet is behaving properly. Good interactions do have quite a profound effect, causing changes in oxytocin and in beta endorphins. Those are actual changes going on in the body of somebody who is stroking a friendly dog. That's why i love interacting with dog (rather than cat).

	<h3>I love photography and painting</h3>

	<p class="pt-3">I'm not addicted to posting on social media, but i really enjoy taking photo of foods and drinks that we eat, even at home. <br><br>
	Back to when i was a child, I'm always like color, colorful things and glittering stuff, until now, I create each of my painting with many different materials, like colored pencil, acrylic,...</p>
	<p class="flow1">I also share my food shot and a lot of recipes on my personal instagram<br>

	I'd love if you follow me there too!</p>

<div class="quotes mx-auto">
	To my mind a picture should be something pleasant, cheerful and pretty. There are too many unpleasant things in life as it is without creating still more of them.
